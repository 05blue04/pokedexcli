## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or later installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokedexcli.git
cd pokedexcli
```
2. Run the Application 
```bash
go run .
```

## Available Commands 🕹️
```bash
help # List available commands
exit # Exit the Pokédex CLI
map # Show the next page of location areas
mapb # Show the previous page of location areas
explore <location_name> # View Pokémon encounters in a location
catch <pokemon_name> # Attempt to catch a Pokémon
inspect <pokemon_name> # View stats for a caught Pokémon
pokedex # Show all caught Pokémon
```

### Catch Mechanics 
When you run:
```bash
catch pikachu
```
The catch success is determined randomly, but weighted by the Pokémon's base experience — the stronger the Pokémon, the harder it is to catch.

The catch formula looks like this:
```bash
catchChance := 0.9 - (baseExperience / 1000)
```
A random float [0.0 - 1.0] is rolled. If the roll is less than catchChance, the Pokémon is caught!
